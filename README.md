# Police Racial Profiling

Cities across California will be implementing new data collection to monitor racial profiling in police stops, in accordance with AB 953, the Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA) of 2015. Now that cities will start collecting this data, the question is how to make the best use of it. This repository explores the effecaciousness of several plausible metrics for racial profiling and compares them against state-of-the-arts tests like the Veil of Darkness Test or the Threshold Test. Our aim is to provide actionable insights for police-makers in small or medium-sized cities who care about racial equity.
